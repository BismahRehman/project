# Student Performance Tracker

This project is a Python-based system to manage and track student grades using Object-Oriented Programming concepts. It calculates averages, checks if students are passing, and provides performance feedback.

## How It Works

1. **Student Class**: Represents each student, storing their name and scores. It provides methods to calculate average scores and check if the student is passing.
2. **PerformanceTracker Class**: Manages multiple students, allowing users to add students, calculate the class average, and display each student's performance.
3. **Main Program**: Continuously prompts the user to enter student data and displays the results.

# Features

- **Add Students**: Allows users to input student names and their scores in three subjects.
- **Calculate Averages**: Computes each studentâ€™s average score as well as the class average.
- **Pass/Fail Status**: Determines if each student is passing based on a minimum passing score (default: 40).
- **Display Performance**: Outputs each student's performance, including their average score and pass/fail status.
